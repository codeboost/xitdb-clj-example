;;Code below Generated From Prompt by Claude 3.7
;;I need a Clojure function which generates a deeply nested map with random keys and random values.
;;I will use this function to generate maps to test a database implementation.
;;Each nested map has at least one key valued by a map and one key valued by a vector.
;;Keys can be keywords, integers, strings, boolean or nil. Values can also be maps or arrays.
;;I should be able to configure: num-keys-per-map and max-array-length and max-nesting-level
